<br>

I am a software engineer at Kepler Group, a digital marketing agency, where I architect and develop infrastructure to support distributed data streams and experiment with statistical models that improve Kepler's marketing optimization and scalability.
I have a degree in applied mathematics from Columbia University and I continue to study math and computational science which have sparked my interest to learn Clojure and functional programming.
My technical literacy is in Python, Hive, Spark, R, SQL, and Pig. For technical enhancement, I am solving Project Euler problems in Clojure and Python while studying a recent interest of mine, complexity science, which I first learned from Professor Allen B. Downey's book "Think Complexity."
My initial interest in complexity theory has grown and has led me to Professor Steven Strogatz's studies on networks and has fueled my desire to join the paradigm shift of scientific experimentation that Stephen Wolfram articulates in "A New Kind of Science."
