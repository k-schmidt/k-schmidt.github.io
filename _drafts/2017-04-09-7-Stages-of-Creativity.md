I just finished a fantastic short book by [James Whittaker](http://www.docjamesw.com/) entitled [*7 Stages of Creativity: Developing Your Creative Self*](https://www.amazon.com/Stages-Creativity-Developing-Your-Creative/dp/1541192079/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8) and I thought that I would share my notes.

Throughout the book, James emphasizes the importance of creativity.
Too many people in today's day and age rely too much on the information that is all around them.
They are quick to Google for solutions, definitions, or documentation instead of taking the career journey of exploration and expertise.
Today, too many people associate expertise to a select few of "gifted" individuals.
I know because I use to be one of them.
But James wants everyone who reads his book to know that creativity and expertise is within everyone's grasp for those who are willing to **work** to achieve it.

The first step to expertise is **Learning**.
One first has to know (or master) a skill in order to allow for creativity.
When learning, we should seek mentors to teach us the material because we will learn what we want to learn much quicker if we seek experts to teach us.
We only have a finite amount of time, therefore learning from anyone *less* than an expert isn't worth it.
Your experts will set the bar for your understanding and how you define expertise so we should choose our mentors wisely.
Choosing the wrong mentor can have negative consequences and prolong your learning stage.
But mentoring is not a one way street, mentees should give back to their mentors so that their mentors feel like their time spent is worth it.
Seek an expert who is good at **one** particular thing.
You should seek a mentor for **each** skill that you are trying to learn.

The second stage of creativity is **Thinking**.
We should be mindful of the things our brain returns to think about for these are the things that are worth investing extra time in and potentially mastering.
Learning a subject deeply is what it takes to become creative so it might as well be something that you continuously think about.

The third stage of creativity is **Seeking**.
Once you have found something that you recognize that you continously think about then you should seek to desire to know more about that subject.
Usually, this will come naturally if it is a true passion.
If it doesn't come naturally then continue to practice the subject and investigate whether you want to continue spending the time to pursue it.
There is no harm in returning to steps 1 and 2 to discover something else worth investing in.
Seeking involves asking questions.
When questions emerge that is a good sign that you have discovered a self-perpetuating interest.
Feed your subject of interest with high-level though experiments.
Investigate the big picture of a problem rather than wading in details.
Bill Gates wanted to solve the high-level problem of getting a PC in every single person's hands around the world.
Notice how this example doesn't contain any details.

Stage 4 of creativity is **Focusing**.
James writes, "Expertise means getting really good at something to the point that much of your knowledge ceases to require active thinking."
People satisfied with being merely good at something don't experience this transition from knowledge to instinct which rarely induces creativity.
If we allow our expertise to pass into intuition then we can allow our instinct and creativity to cross-pollinate, allowing intuition to work on the habitual parts of a problem while our creativity extends our mental models.
Specializing is worth it.
While knowledge of a skill will allow you to be a contributing member of society, mastering a subject is personally rewarding and distinguishes you from the crowd.

Stage 5 of creativity is **Knowing**.
To nurture creativity you must always view yourself as a work in progress.
The fulfilling part is in the journey, not in the end result.
If we cease to learn then the world will pass us by.
This is what happened to Microsoft when they failed to recognize the Mobile marketplace and what also might be happening to Apple failing to recognize IoT.
Lastly, never look at other experts as competition.

Stage 6 of creativity is **Creating**.
Creativity is finicky and requires the right time, space, and mindset.
James says there are four things to consider in order to have your most creative moments.
First, find your center.
Be hyper-sensitive about where you are most creative and when you most often get creative ideas.
Similar to the advice in stage 2, be mindful about these creative spaces and make a note of them.
Second, understand your distractions.
Distractions are wonderful but we should be mindful of where, when, and what your brain responds to and recognize those positive distractions.
Third, know your inspirations.
Last, seek out solitude.

Stage 7 and the last stage of creativity is **Living**.
Aim to learn something from everyone you meet.
People are the best chance to challenge our ideas and provide a spark for creativity.
Add a creative side hustle if you aren't practicing creativity daily.
Embrace the creativity around you.
